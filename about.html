    <h1 align="center">History of Tesla, Inc.</h1>
    <hr>

    
    <p>This is the corporate history of Tesla, Inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer and clean energy company founded in San Carlos, California in 2003 by American entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The company is named after Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla. Tesla is the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer, and, as of the end of 2021, Tesla's cumulative global vehicle sales totaled 2.3 million units.[1]</p>
    <h1>The beginnings â€“ Roadster and private funding</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Tesla was founded (as Tesla Motors) on July 1, 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in San Carlos, California.[2][3] The founders were influenced to start the company after General Motors recalled all its EV1 electric cars in 2003 and then destroyed them,[4] and seeing the higher fuel efficiency of battery-electric cars as an opportunity to break the usual correlation between high performance and low fuel economy in automobiles.[5] The AC Propulsion tzero also inspired the company's first vehicle, the Roadster.[6][7] Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor".[8]</p>
    <p>an Wright was the third employee, joining a few months later.[2] The three went looking for venture capital (VC) funding in January 2004[2] and connected with Elon Musk, who contributed US$6.5 million of the initial (Series A) US$7.5 million[9] round of investment in February 2004 and became chairman of the board of directors.[2] Musk then appointed Eberhard as the CEO.[10] J.B. Straubel joined in May 2004[2] as the fifth employee.[11] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five (Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk and Straubel) to call themselves co-founders.[12]</p>
    <p>Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[13] Eberhard acknowledged that Musk was the person who insisted from the beginning on a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer body and that Musk led design of components ranging from the power electronics module to the headlamps and other styling.[14] Musk received the Global Green 2006 product design award for his design of the Tesla Roadster, presented by Mikhail Gorbachev,[15] and he also received the 2007 Index Design award for his design of the Tesla Roadster.[16]</p>
    <p>From the beginning, Musk consistently maintained that Tesla's long-term strategic goal was to create affordable mass market electric vehicles.[17] Tesla's goal was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then moving into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts.
    </p>
    <p>By January 2009, Tesla had raised US$187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed US$70 million of his own money to the company.[26] On May 19, 2009, Germany's Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz, acquired an equity stake of less than 10% of Tesla for a reported US$50 million.[29] According to Musk, the Daimler investment saved Tesla.[30] In July 2009, Daimler announced that Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments bought 40% of Daimler's interest in Tesla.[31]</p>
    <h1>2009 Department of Energy loan</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In June 2009 Tesla was approved to receive US$465 million in interest-bearing loans from the United States Department of Energy. The funding, part of the US$8 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, supported engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology.[32] The low-interest loan program was created in 2007 during the George W. Bush administration, and is not related to the "bailout" funds that GM and Chrysler received, nor are they related to the 2009 economic stimulus package.[33] Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with a US$12 million interest. Tesla was the first car company to have fully repaid the government;[34] Nissan repaid their loan in 2017, Ford expects to repay their loan in 2022, and Fisker went bankrupt and defaulted on their loan.[35]

        The company announced in early August 2009 that it had achieved overall corporate profitability for the month of July 2009.[36] The company said it earned approximately US$1 million on revenue of US$20 million. Profitability arose primarily from improved gross margin on the 2010 Roadster, the second iteration of Tesla's award-winning sports car. Tesla, which like all automakers records revenue when products are delivered, shipped a record 109 vehicles in July and reported a surge in new Roadster purchases. In September 2009, Tesla announced a US$82.5 million round to accelerate Tesla's retail expansion.[37] Daimler participated in the round to maintain equity ownership from its initial investment.[37]</p>
        <h1>SolarCity acquisition</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>On August 1, 2016, Tesla agreed to acquire SolarCity Corp. for US$2.6 billion in stock. SolarCity was then the largest installer of rooftop solar systems in the United States.[109] More than 85% of unaffiliated Tesla and SolarCity shareholders voted to approve the acquisition,[110][111] which closed on November 21, 2016.[112]</p>
        <p>After it acquired SolarCity, Tesla stopped using door to door sales tactics for solar systems; instead, it markets and sells its products at company showrooms. For a short time, Tesla partnered with Home Depot to sell solar and energy products through in store kiosks.[113] At the time, it did not provide a leasing option for solar panels, and consumers had to purchase them.[114]</p>
